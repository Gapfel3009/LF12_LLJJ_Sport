It engages multiple muscle groups, including the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core. Suitable for all fitness levels, push-ups can be modified or progressed to match individual goals. It requires no equipment and is a fundamental movement used in calisthenic, strength training, sports conditioning, and rehabilitation programs.","https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Push-Up.gif", true),

It involves suspending your body parallel to the ground, supported only by your hands, while your legs are spread wide apart in a straddle position. It is popular in calisthenics, gymnastics, and street workout routines, requiring months or years of consistent training to achieve.", "https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Straddle-Planche.gif", true),

This brief one-arm support increases load on the working side and challenges your balance and rotational control. It is often used to improve unilateral strength, coordination, and postural integrity.", "https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Single-Arm-Raise-Push-up.gif", false),

It targets the same muscles as a standard push-up but increases the load on one side. This movement is frequently used in calisthenics and functional training as a stepping stone toward single-arm push-ups.","https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Archer-Push-Up.gif", false),

This movement builds strength in the shoulders, core, and arms, and is often used as a precursor to the more difficult Straddle and Full Planche. By leaning your body forward while maintaining support on your hands, the Lean Planche provides a foundation to build strength and control for mastering more advanced calisthenic moves.","https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lean-planche.png", false),];
